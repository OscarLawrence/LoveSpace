# Scientific Trading Bot - Real Capital, Real Results

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Market Data Engine** (`market_data/`)
   - Real-time Binance WebSocket feeds
   - Historical data management with validation
   - Data quality monitoring and alerts

2. **Strategy Engine** (`strategies/`)
   - Mathematical strategy implementations
   - Statistical validation framework
   - Walk-forward optimization system

3. **Execution Engine** (`execution/`)
   - Real Binance API trading
   - Order management and tracking
   - Slippage and latency monitoring

4. **Risk Management** (`risk/`)
   - Position sizing (Kelly criterion + volatility adjustment)
   - Stop loss systems (statistical and time-based)
   - Portfolio-level risk controls

5. **Analytics** (`analytics/`)
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Statistical analysis of results
   - Strategy attribution and optimization

## Implementation Standards

### Mathematical Rigor
- All strategies must pass hypothesis testing (p < 0.05)
- Out-of-sample validation required before live trading
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for all performance metrics
- Transaction cost modeling based on real execution data

### Code Quality
- Type hints on all functions
- 95%+ test coverage
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance benchmarks

### Operational Standards
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Automated alerts for anomalies
- Complete audit trail
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Market data ingestion and storage
- [ ] Basic execution engine with order tracking
- [ ] Risk management framework

### Phase 2: Strategy Implementation (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Correlation breakdown detection strategy
- [ ] Mean reversion strategy with statistical validation
- [ ] Momentum strategy with regime detection
- [ ] Multi-strategy portfolio allocation

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Walk-forward parameter optimization
- [ ] Regime detection and adaptation
- [ ] Transaction cost optimization
- [ ] Performance attribution analysis

### Phase 4: Production (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Live trading with small capital ($100-500)
- [ ] Real-time monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Performance reporting
- [ ] Scaling procedures

## Success Criteria

### Mathematical Validation
