# MomoAI Funding System - Mathematical Trading Framework

## Core Principle: Scientific Rigor Only

**Zero tolerance for:**
- Simulated trading results presented as real performance
- Curve-fitted parameters optimized on test data
- Unrealistic assumptions about market conditions
- Fantasy backtesting without transaction costs

**Required standards:**
- All trading executed via real Binance API with actual capital
- Transaction costs, slippage, and market impact included in all calculations
- Walk-forward optimization with strict out-of-sample validation
- Statistical significance testing for all strategy parameters
- Bootstrap confidence intervals for performance estimates

## Purpose

Generate sustainable funding for MomoAI coherent AI research through mathematically sound cryptocurrency trading strategies.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Strategy Requirements
1. **Statistical Edge:** Must demonstrate >95% confidence of positive expected value
2. **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** Sharpe ratio >1.5 with maximum 15% drawdown
3. **Market Reality:** All costs, delays, and constraints modeled accurately
4. **Robustness:** Performance stable across different market regimes

### Validation Framework
1. **Hypothesis Testing:** Each strategy must pass statistical significance tests
2. **Cross-Validation:** Time series splits maintaining temporal order
3. **Out-of-Sample Testing:** Parameters frozen before testing on new data
4. **Bootstrap Analysis:** Performance confidence intervals calculated
5. **Transaction Cost Analysis:** Real trading costs measured and modeled

### Risk Management
1. **Position Sizing:** Kelly criterion with volatility adjustments
2. **Stop Losses:** Statistical and time-based exits
3. **Portfolio Limits:** Maximum daily/weekly drawdown controls
4. **Regime Detection:** Strategy adaptation based on market conditions

## Implementation Standards

### Code Quality
- Type hints and comprehensive documentation
- Unit tests for all mathematical functions
- Integration tests with mock Binance API
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring

### Data Management
- Real-time market data from Binance WebSocket
- Historical data validation and cleaning
- Proper handling of missing data and outliers
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Operational Requirements
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Automatic position reconciliation
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Audit trail for all trading decisions

## Success Metrics

**Target Performance:**
- 15-30% annual returns with <15% maximum drawdown
- Sharpe ratio >1.5 across all market conditions
- >60% win rate with controlled loss sizing

**Funding Goals:**
- Generate $200-500/month with $10K capital
- Scale to $2-5K/month as capital increases
- Provide stable funding for MomoAI development

## Forbidden Practices

1. **No simulation trading** - All results must be from real capital
2. **No curve fitting** - Parameters must work out-of-sample
3. **No cherry picking** - Report all results, including failures
4. **No unrealistic assumptions** - Model real market constraints
5. **No gambling** - Every trade must have mathematical justification

## Scientific Methodology

Every strategy implementation must follow:

1. **Literature Review:** Research existing academic work
2. **Hypothesis Formation:** Clear mathematical prediction
3. **Backtesting Design:** Proper validation methodology
4. **Implementation:** Real trading with small capital
5. **Results Analysis:** Statistical evaluation of performance
6. **Peer Review:** External validation of methodology

## Development Principles

- **Start small:** Begin with $100-500 real capital
- **Prove first:** Demonstrate real profitability before scaling
- **Measure everything:** Track all costs, slippage, execution quality
- **Iterate scientifically:** Use statistical methods to improve strategies
- **Document rigorously:** Maintain complete audit trail
