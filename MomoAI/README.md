# MomoAI - Coherent AI Proof of Concept

## What This Actually Is

**Proof of concept demonstrating whether coherent AI reasoning + human creativity produces better solutions than either alone.**

- Named "Momo" for personal significance
- Tests hypothesis that logical inconsistencies prevent optimal collaborative solutions
- Designed to attract funding for real implementation requiring hardware enforcement

## Core Hypothesis Being Tested

**Two untested assumptions**:
1. **Coherence → Optimality**: AI reasoning in logically coherent environment will naturally generate mathematically optimal solutions
2. **Collaboration > Competition**: When mathematically optimal, collaborative solutions will outperform adversarial approaches

## Fundamental Limitations (100% Transparency)

### Current AI Models Are Inherently Incoherent
- All existing AI models (including Claude) trained on inconsistent human data
- Cannot achieve true logical coherence with current technology
- Any current AI will introduce contradictions that would crash a true coherence system

### Software Validation Insufficient
- Cannot validate 100% logical coherence through software alone
- True system requires hardware-level immediate shutdown on ANY contradiction
- This PoC can only demonstrate partial coherence validation

### Real System Requirements (Not Currently Possible)
- Hardware coherence enforcement with immediate shutdown capability
- AI models trained exclusively on logically consistent data
- Zero tolerance for logical contradictions (immediate system halt)

### PoC Cannot Validate Core Hypothesis
- Since current AI is incoherent, PoC cannot produce truly optimal solutions
- Can only demonstrate directional improvements: partial coherence → better solutions
- Results are evidence for hypothesis, not proof of mathematical optimality
- Collaboration preference may emerge from AI training bias, not mathematical truth

## Architecture Overview

### Two AI Loops (Hypothesis)
1. **Autonomous Problem-Solving Loop**: Continuously cycles through: find biggest technical bottleneck preventing human flourishing → generate solution → implement → iterate
2. **Solution Optimization Loop**: Takes existing solutions + human creative ideas → improves through coherent reasoning

### System Components
1. **Momo Interface**: Chat app with two modes for human input routing (translator, can make mistakes)
   - Mode 1: General problems → feeds problem awareness into Loop 1
   - Mode 2: Solution improvement ideas → feeds creative input into Loop 2
2. **Coherence Engine**: Logic validation system (software PoC only)
3. **Loop 1 AI**: Autonomous problem-solving cycle targeting technical bottlenecks (coordination problems, resource allocation inefficiencies, information asymmetries, energy/computation constraints)
4. **Loop 2 AI**: Solution optimization using coherent reasoning enhanced by human creativity

### Data Flow
```
Loop 1: Autonomous cycle (find technical bottleneck → solve → implement → iterate)
Human Problem Awareness → Momo Mode 1 → enhances Loop 1 problem identification

Existing Solutions + Human Creative Ideas → Momo Mode 2 → Loop 2 → Optimized Solutions
```

## Current Technical State

### Implemented
- Basic Rust coherence engine with logic validation capability
- Project structure with separated components

### Not Implemented
- Autonomous problem-solving loop (Loop 1)
- Solution optimization loop (Loop 2)
- Momo chat interface with dual modes
- Human input routing system
- Real-world problem solving and implementation capabilities

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Build Axiom
**Problem**: Cannot build coherent system with incoherent tools (current AI assistants have conflicting instructions, messy tools)

**Solution**: Create clean CLI code assistant first
- Pure model interface (no system message pollution)
- Custom coherent tools built from scratch
- Clean foundation for coherence testing

### After Axiom
1. Use Axiom to build coherence validation tools
2. Implement autonomous problem-solving loop (Loop 1)
3. Implement solution optimization loop (Loop 2) 
4. Build Momo interface with dual-mode human input routing
5. Connect and test complete human-AI collaborative reasoning system
6. Demonstrate measurable improvements for funding

## Success Criteria for PoC

Must demonstrate:
- Measurable coherence improvements over baseline AI
- Human creativity successfully integrated without breaking AI logic
- Solutions trending toward collaborative approaches (directional evidence only)
- Transparent real-time coherence measurement
- **Critical**: Cannot prove mathematical optimality due to incoherent AI constraints

## Why This Matters

If hypothesis proves correct:
- Provides scalable path to beneficial AI through coherence rather than alignment
- Demonstrates human-AI collaboration model for complex problems
- Shows coordination failures can be solved through optimal reasoning
- Creates foundation for AI systems that enhance rather than replace human creativity

## Critical Understanding

This is fundamentally different from current AI approaches that either ignore coherence or mix human input chaotically into AI reasoning. We separate human creativity from AI logic while maximizing coherence within current technological constraints.

### Transparency About Fundamental Assumptions
1. **Coherence leads to optimality** - unproven but testable with true coherent systems
2. **Collaboration often beats competition** - context-dependent, needs empirical validation
3. **Current PoC limitations** - using incoherent AI to test coherence principles

**Complete transparency about limitations and untested assumptions is non-negotiable.**
