Perfect — let’s keep it **high-level and modular** so you can later flesh it out with a coding LLM.

# 🛠️ Implementation Plan: **Code Coherence Validator**

---

## **1. Define the Goal**

* Input:

  * **Prompt** (user request)
  * **Code** (assistant’s output)
* Output:

  * **Coherence Score** (0–1)
  * **Reasons / Feedback** (e.g., “Code runs but does not match requirements”)
  * **Decision**: Pass / Flag / Reject

---

## **2. Pipeline Overview**

1. **Static Checks (Cheap, Deterministic)**

   * Syntax validity (does it compile?).
   * Variable/function consistency (e.g., references to undefined identifiers).
   * Linters / AST parsing.

2. **Requirement Extraction (LLM)**

   * Convert user prompt into structured requirements.

     * Example: {Task: "validate coherence", Constraints: \["no regex-only hacks"]}.

3. **Code Understanding (LLM + AST)**

   * Summarize what the code actually does in plain language.
   * Extract structural info from AST (functions, complexity hints, dependencies).

4. **Alignment Check (Comparator)**

   * Compare **requirements (step 2)** with **code summary (step 3)**.
   * Decide if they align or diverge.

5. **Executable Test (Optional Sandbox)**

   * Run code with dummy inputs.
   * Check for runtime errors.
   * For well-defined tasks: auto-generate simple unit tests from requirements.

6. **Optional Logical Consistency (Z3)**

   * Translate requirements & code behavior into constraints.
   * Check satisfiability → contradictions = incoherence.

7. **Scoring & Decision Layer**

   * Weighted scoring:

     * Static checks = 20%
     * Alignment (req vs. code) = 50%
     * Executability = 20%
     * Logical consistency = 10%
   * Threshold:

     * > 0.8 → Pass
     * 0.5–0.8 → Flag
     * <0.5 → Reject

---

## **3. Deployment Plan**

* **Prototype Stage**

  * Static checks with `ast` + simple LLM summaries.
  * Manual evaluation on coherent vs. incoherent outputs.

* **Integration Stage**

  * Wrap coherence validator as a service (API or module).
  * Run after every code generation.

* **Continuous Improvement**

  * Log flagged outputs.
  * Build dataset of {prompt, code, coherence verdict}.
  * Fine-tune coherence classifier (LLM or smaller custom model).

---

## **4. Future Enhancements**

* **Interactive feedback:** Instead of rejecting, explain mismatch → “This code uses regex, but you asked for a logical validator.”
* **Task-specific validators:** For certain domains (e.g., SQL, data pipelines), add domain-specific coherence checks.
* **Confidence calibration:** Use multiple LLMs for redundancy on alignment checks.

---

✅ **Summary:**
The Code Coherence Validator has **three pillars**:

1. **Static structure** (cheap filters).
2. **Semantic alignment** (prompt vs. code summary).
3. **Optional deep reasoning** (sandbox + Z3).

It returns a score + reason, so you can gatekeep incoherent code before giving it to users.

Would you like me to also draft a **parallel plan for “prompt coherence” and “code coherence” together** — so you have a single end-to-end pipeline vision for your assistant?
