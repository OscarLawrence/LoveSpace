# Axiom - Clean CLI Code Assistant

## Purpose

Axiom is the bootstrap component for building coherent AI tools. It provides:

- Pure model interface (no system message pollution)
- Custom coherent tools built from scratch
- Clean foundation for coherence testing

## Architecture

### Essential Coherent Tools
- Clean Read tool (no system message pollution)
- Clean Write tool (pure file operations)  
- Clean Bash tool (direct command execution)
- Basic Search tools (coherent file searching)

### Coherence Validator
- Measures logical consistency in reasoning chains
- Foundation for all subsequent coherence checking
- Can be built with incoherent tools (measurement vs generation)

## Bootstrap Process

1. **Phase 1**: Build with minimal external dependencies
2. **Phase 2**: Use Axiom to rebuild itself with higher coherence
3. **Phase 3**: Complete elimination of external incoherent tools

This follows the principle: "Cannot build coherent system with incoherent tools, but need tools to build tools."
