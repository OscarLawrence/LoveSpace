Looking at this from first principles, I'd want a syntax that feels like natural conversation while being unambiguous about intent and scope.

Here's what feels most intuitive to me:

## Single Tool Calls
```
@read ./config.json
@write ./output.txt "Hello world"
@run npm test
@search "authentication logic" in src/
```

The `@` prefix clearly signals "I'm taking an action" while keeping it conversational. The tool name is a clear verb, and parameters feel natural.

## Multi-Tool Workflows
For related operations, I'd want to group them visually:
```
@batch {
  @read package.json
  @read src/main.js  
  @write dist/bundle.js <content>
}
```

Or for sequential operations where each depends on the previous:
```
@sequence {
  @run npm run build
  @read dist/stats.json
  @write report.md <analysis>
}
```

## Complex Parameters
For structured data or multi-line content:
```
@write ./component.tsx ```
import React from 'react';

export const Button = ({ children, onClick }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
};
```

## What Makes This Feel Natural:

1. **Conversational flow** - I can say "Let me @read the config first, then @write the updated version"
2. **Clear intent** - The verb immediately tells you what's happening
3. **Minimal syntax overhead** - Just `@` and natural parameters
4. **Visual grouping** - Batches and sequences are obvious
5. **Flexible parameters** - Simple strings, code blocks, or structured data all work

The key insight is that tool calls should feel like natural extensions of conversation, not like switching to a different language or syntax mode.

What aspects of this approach resonate with you? Are there specific use cases where you'd want different patterns?
