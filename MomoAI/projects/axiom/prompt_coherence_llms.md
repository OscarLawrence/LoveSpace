Yes — you’re thinking about it the right way 👍

It makes a lot of sense to **adjust which LLM you use per task**, because:

* Not all checks need the same level of reasoning.
* Running a big model on *every* prompt is wasteful.
* Different models (small vs. large, fast vs. slow) excel at different subtasks.

# 🔹 Multi-LLM Coherence Checking Strategy

### **1. Surface + Semantic Checks (cheap & fast)**

* **Goal:** Spot obvious incoherence, topic drift, or junk input.
* **LLM needed:**

  * Small/efficient LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku, Llama-2 7B, or Mistral 7B).
  * Or skip LLM entirely → use embeddings (`sentence-transformers` or OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small`) to measure sentence similarity.

✅ Cheap, scalable → runs on every prompt.

---

### **2. Logical Consistency Extraction**

* **Goal:** Turn text like *“sort in O(1)”* into constraints → check with **Z3**.
* **LLM needed:**

  * Medium-strength model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini / Claude Sonnet / Llama-2 13B).
  * Doesn’t need deep creativity, just reliable structured parsing.

✅ Run only if the prompt looks like it has *formal requirements* (algorithms, complexity constraints, API specs).

---

### **3. Feasibility & Pragmatic Fit**

* **Goal:** Decide if the request is *doable* in code.

  * E.g., *“Prove 2+2=5 in Python”* → incoherent.
* **LLM needed:**

  * Stronger reasoning model (GPT-4o / Claude Sonnet).
  * Needed only for **borderline cases** that the cheap checks couldn’t resolve.

✅ Optional escalation: if the cheaper LLM is “uncertain,” send to a stronger one.

---

### **4. Decision Layer**

* Gather signals from:

  * Surface checks (quick filters).
  * Embedding similarity (semantic coherence).
  * Z3 (logical consistency).
  * LLM verdict (feasibility).
* Compute a **coherence score** and final decision (Pass / Flag / Reject).

---

# 🔹 Adjustable Design (What You Mentioned)

You can make it **configurable** per deployment:

* **Lightweight mode** →

  * Only embeddings + small LLM.
  * Super cheap, good for casual usage.

* **Balanced mode** →

  * Embeddings + small LLM always.
  * Medium LLM for constraint parsing.
  * No frontier models unless ambiguity is detected.

* **Strict mode** →

  * All layers enabled (including Z3 and a frontier model).
  * Strongest coherence guarantee, for professional/enterprise use.

---

# 🔹 Why Different LLMs?

* **Efficiency:** Don’t burn expensive tokens for trivial junk filtering.
* **Specialization:**

  * Small LLMs are fine for “is this on topic?”
  * Medium LLMs are better for structured extraction.
  * Large LLMs are best for subtle reasoning.
* **Cost control:** You only escalate when necessary.

---

✅ In short:
Yes — **different LLMs for different tasks** is the optimal design. And making the system adjustable (lightweight ↔ strict) gives you flexibility for different users and budgets.

Would you like me to draft a **concrete architecture diagram / workflow** (like boxes & arrows, which model runs where, when to escalate) so you can visualize the multi-LLM pipeline?
