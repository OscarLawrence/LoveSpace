Perfect — an **implementation plan** makes sense before jumping into code. Here’s a structured approach you can follow to add a *coherence gatekeeper* to your coding assistant:

---

# 🛠️ Implementation Plan: Prompt Coherence Checker

## **1. Define the Goals**

* Input: Raw human prompt (e.g., “Write Python code to sort a list, but also tell me who won the World Cup”).
* Output:

  * **Coherence Score** (0–1 or 0–100 scale).
  * **Reasons** for incoherence (topic drift, contradiction, vagueness, etc.).
  * **Decision**: Pass / Flag / Reject.

---

## **2. Pipeline Overview**

1. **Preprocessing**

   * Normalize text (strip whitespace, check length).
   * Basic grammar/spellcheck (optional).

2. **Surface-Level Filters** (cheap checks)

   * Reject empty/very short prompts.
   * Flag prompts with too many unrelated sentences (e.g., detected via embeddings).

3. **Semantic Coherence Check** (LLM + embeddings)

   * Break prompt into sentences/clauses.
   * Generate embeddings for each.
   * Compute pairwise cosine similarity → if too many pairs are low similarity, mark as incoherent.
   * Optionally: Use an LLM to explicitly judge *“Does this request make sense as a single programming task?”*.

4. **Logical Consistency Check** (Z3 or symbolic reasoning)

   * Use an LLM to extract structured rules from the text:

     * Example: *“The function must run in O(1)” → Constraint(Complexity=O(1))*.
     * *“The function must sort a list” → Constraint(Task=Sort, Complexity≥O(n log n))*.
   * Encode constraints into Z3.
   * Run satisfiability check → UNSAT = logical contradiction.

5. **Feasibility & Pragmatic Check** (LLM classification)

   * Ask LLM: *“Is this a valid coding request?”*
   * Examples of failures:

     * Impossible tasks (*“Prove 2+2=5 in Python”*).
     * Non-coding requests disguised as coding prompts (*“Write Python code, but also explain my dreams”*).

6. **Scoring & Decision**

   * Weighted score:

     * Surface-level: 20%
     * Semantic: 40%
     * Logical: 30%
     * Feasibility: 10%
   * Thresholds:

     * Score > 0.8 → Pass
     * 0.5–0.8 → Flag (ask user to clarify)
     * < 0.5 → Reject

---

## **3. Technical Components**

* **LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)**

  * For semantic checks, feasibility check, and natural-language-to-logic extraction.
* **Embeddings Model**

  * SentenceTransformers (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for cheap coherence similarity.
* **Z3 Solver**

  * For contradiction detection in extracted logical rules.
* **Glue Code**

  * Python pipeline orchestrating all checks.
  * Configurable scoring system.

---

## **4. Example Flow**

**Prompt:**
“Write a Python function that sorts a list in O(1) time and also calculates the Fibonacci sequence.”

* **Surface check:** Passes length/grammar.
* **Semantic check:** Similar sentences, but mixing sorting + Fibonacci = multi-topic → deduct score.
* **Logical check (Z3):** Sorting + O(1) = contradiction → fail.
* **Feasibility check:** Sorting in O(1) = impossible.

➡️ Final Coherence Score: 0.35 → **Reject with explanation**: “Contradictory constraints: O(1) sorting is not possible.”

---

## **5. Deployment Plan**

1. **Prototype Stage**

   * Build pipeline in Python (OpenAI API + Z3 + embeddings).
   * Test on synthetic incoherent vs. coherent prompts.
   * Collect evaluation metrics.

2. **Integration Stage**

   * Wrap coherence checker as a **microservice** (FastAPI/Flask).
   * Expose endpoint `/check_prompt` → returns score + reasons.

3. **Assistant Integration**

   * Before sending to coding model:

     * Call `/check_prompt`.
     * If flagged, either auto-reject or ask user to clarify.

4. **Continuous Improvement**

   * Log flagged prompts.
   * Collect real-world incoherent cases.
   * Retrain/refine coherence scoring.

---

## **6. Future Enhancements**

* **Interactive clarification**: Instead of rejecting, auto-ask: *“Your request seems contradictory (O(1) sorting). Did you mean efficient sorting (O(n log n))?”*
* **Custom coherence models**: Train lightweight classifiers on your dataset of coherent vs. incoherent prompts.
* **Explainability layer**: Always return *why* the prompt was judged incoherent.

---

✅ With this pipeline, you don’t need “perfect” coherence testing. Instead, you get a robust *filter + feedback system* that will block most harmful incoherence before hitting the coding model.

Do you want me to **draft a concrete scoring rubric** (with specific rules/weights for each check) so you can implement the coherence score right away?
