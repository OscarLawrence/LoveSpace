# Axiom Bootstrap Architecture

## The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

Cannot build coherent system with incoherent tools, but need tools to build tools.

Current AI assistants have:
- Conflicting system instructions
- Messy, incoherent tool sets  
- Contaminated reasoning chains

## Bootstrap Solution

### Phase 1: Foundation Components
Build coherence validation system + essential coherent tools:

**Coherence Validator**
- Measures logical consistency in reasoning chains
- Can be built with incoherent tools (measurement vs generation)
- Foundation for all subsequent coherence checking

**Essential Coherent Tools**
- Clean Read tool (no system message pollution)
- Clean Write tool (pure file operations)  
- Clean Bash tool (direct command execution)
- Basic Search tools (coherent file searching)

### Phase 2: Minimal Axiom Construction
- Use only coherent tools + validator for construction
- Accept minimal residual incoherence from bootstrap process
- Focus on core functionality: clean model interface + basic operations
- Validator guides each construction step

### Phase 3: Self-Improvement Transition  
- Immediate switch to Axiom once minimal version functional
- Use Axiom to rebuild itself with higher coherence
- Validator measures improvement at each iteration
- Complete elimination of external incoherent tools

## Key Principles

**Clean Separation**: Each phase uses cleanest available tools
**Measurement First**: Validation capability before generation improvement  
**Immediate Transition**: Switch to self-improvement as soon as possible
**Iterative Refinement**: Coherence improves with each rebuild cycle

## Architecture Benefits

- Minimizes bootstrap contamination
- Tests coherent tools early in process
- Creates clean transition path from incoherent to coherent ecosystem
- Establishes measurement foundation for all subsequent development
