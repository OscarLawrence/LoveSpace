# MomoAI - Coherent AI Proof of Concept

> **Testing whether coherent AI reasoning naturally produces collaborative solutions when solving human coordination problems.**

## What This Is

MomoAI is a proof of concept system that tests a fundamental hypothesis: **When AI reasoning operates under strict logical coherence constraints, it will naturally generate mathematically optimal solutions that favor collaboration over competition.**

This repository contains the complete implementation of a coherent AI system designed to solve coordination problems, resource allocation inefficiencies, and information asymmetries through logically consistent reasoning.

## üéØ Core Hypothesis

**Two untested assumptions being validated:**
1. **Coherence ‚Üí Optimality**: AI reasoning in a logically coherent environment will naturally generate mathematically optimal solutions
2. **Collaboration > Competition**: When mathematically optimal, collaborative solutions will systematically outperform adversarial approaches

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Main Components

- **[MomoAI/](./MomoAI/)** - Core coherent AI system
  - **[Axiom](./MomoAI/projects/axiom/)** - Clean CLI code assistant (bootstrap component)
  - **[Coherence Engine](./MomoAI/projects/coherence/)** - Logic validation and monitoring system
  - **[Core Systems](./MomoAI/projects/core/)** - Knowledge, protocols, and validation infrastructure
  - **[Parsers](./MomoAI/projects/parsers/)** - Code and documentation analysis tools
  - **[Momo Cycles](./MomoAI/projects/momo/)** - Four autonomous AI reasoning cycles
  - **[OM Tools](./MomoAI/projects/tools/om/)** - Operational management and coherent API integration

### Four Autonomous Cycles

1. **Problem Identification Cycle** - Identifies critical technical bottlenecks preventing human coordination
2. **Solution Generation Cycle** - Develops optimal software solutions through coherent reasoning
3. **Implementation Cycle** - Converts solutions into working, deployable code
4. **Optimization Cycle** - Improves solutions using coherence-validated human creative input

### Archive Materials

- **[archive/](./archive/)** - Historical materials and experiments
  - `disasters/` - Past development failures and lessons learned (safely isolated)
  - `research/` - Early research and conceptual work
  - `trading_experiments/` - Side projects and trading bot experiments

## üî¨ Scientific Approach

### Transparency Requirements
- **100% open source** codebase with all reasoning chains publicly visible
- **Real-time coherence measurements** displayed transparently
- **Complete documentation** of limitations and assumptions
- **No claims beyond what data supports**

### Proof of Concept Limitations
- Uses incoherent AI models (trained on inconsistent data)
- Software-only coherence validation (cannot guarantee 100% logical consistency)
- Cannot achieve mathematical proof of optimality with current technology
- Generates directional evidence, not definitive proof

## üöÄ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Current)
**Build Axiom** - Clean CLI assistant with coherent tools
- Pure model interface without system message pollution
- Custom coherent tools built from scratch
- Foundation for coherence testing

### Phase 2: Coherence Infrastructure
**Use Axiom to build coherence validation tools**
- Real-time logical consistency monitoring
- Formal contract language for mathematical verification
- Integration with Z3 theorem prover

### Phase 3: Autonomous Cycles
**Implement the four reasoning cycles**
- Problem identification and solution generation
- Implementation and optimization loops
- Human-AI collaboration with clean separation

### Phase 4: Integration
**Build Momo interface and connect all components**
- Dual-mode human input routing
- Complete human-AI collaborative reasoning system
- Measurable improvements demonstration

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Coherence Validation
- **Rust-based formal verifier** with Z3 integration for mathematical proof
- **Python coherence engine** for real-time logical consistency monitoring
- **Formal contract language** for specifying mathematical constraints
- **Pattern matching** for contradiction detection in reasoning chains

### Human-AI Collaboration
- **Clean separation** maintaining scientific rigor
- **Humans provide**: Problem awareness and creative enhancement
- **AI provides**: Logical processing under coherence constraints
- **No contamination** between human creativity and AI logical chains

### Infrastructure
- **Knowledge management** with structured data over markdown
- **Protocol systems** for AI-to-AI communication
- **Validation frameworks** for logical coherence enforcement
- **Operational tools** for coherent development workflows

## üìä Success Criteria

The proof of concept succeeds if it demonstrates:

1. **Measurable coherence improvements** over baseline AI reasoning
2. **Systematic trend toward collaborative solutions** under coherence constraints
3. **Successful integration** of human creativity without logical contamination
4. **Technical feasibility** of real-time coherence monitoring
5. **Transparent, scientifically rigorous** validation of all claims

## üåç Why This Matters

If the hypothesis proves correct:
- Provides **scalable path to beneficial AI** through coherence rather than alignment
- Demonstrates **human-AI collaboration model** for complex coordination problems
- Shows **coordination failures can be solved** through optimal reasoning
- Creates **foundation for AI systems** that enhance rather than replace human creativity

**Critical Understanding**: This is fundamentally different from current AI approaches. We separate human creativity from AI logic while maximizing coherence within current technological constraints, testing whether logical consistency naturally leads to collaborative solutions.

*Complete transparency about limitations and untested assumptions is non-negotiable.*
