## MVP Progression

### Stage 1: Emotion Sharing
- Capture and transmit basic emotional states
- Binary validation: does recipient feel what sender felt?
- Success metric: >70% accuracy in emotion recognition

### Stage 2: Sensory Experience
- Share visual/auditory experiences between minds
- Test with simple sensory inputs (colors, sounds, textures)
- Success metric: Recipient can identify transmitted sensory data

### Stage 3: Memory Transmission
- Direct transfer of episodic memories
- Start with simple, recent experiences
- Success metric: Recipient can accurately describe transmitted memory

### Stage 4: Skill Transfer
- Transmit learned motor skills, knowledge patterns
- Test with simple tasks (musical scales, mathematical concepts)
- Success metric: Measurable skill acquisition without traditional learning

### Stage 5: Collective Consciousness
- Multiple minds sharing simultaneous experience
- Collaborative problem-solving with shared cognitive resources
- Success metric: Group performance exceeds sum of individual capabilities
