## Total: 50k lines

## MVP Flow
1. Stakeholders submit position statements
2. System extracts core concerns/values
3. Generates hybrid solutions addressing multiple concerns
4. Stakeholders iterate on proposals
5. Consensus scoring identifies viable paths
6. Implementation tracking

## Success Metrics
- Solutions address >80% of stakeholder concerns
- Participants report increased satisfaction vs traditional voting
- Time to consensus decreases with system usage

## Core Concept
Collaborative Decision Engine transforms competitive zero-sum scenarios into collaborative positive-sum outcomes. When groups face decisions, instead of voting (which creates winners/losers), the system facilitates collaborative synthesis where all perspectives contribute to better solutions.

## Key Innovations
1. **Perspective Mapping**: AI extracts core values/concerns from each position
2. **Solution Synthesis**: Generates hybrid approaches that address multiple concerns  
3. **Outcome Prediction**: Models long-term consequences for all stakeholders
4. **Consensus Pathfinding**: Finds decision paths where everyone gains something meaningful

## Applications
- Resource allocation
- Policy decisions
- Organizational management
- Community planning
- International disputes

## Impact Theory
Competition assumes fixed resources, but most human conflicts stem from different values/priorities, not actual scarcity. This system reveals hidden synergies where apparent opponents actually want different things that can coexist. Each successful collaborative decision creates precedent and trust, making future collaboration easier.
