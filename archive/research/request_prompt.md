  You are an expert systems architect tasked with identifying humanity's
  most critical technological gap. Analyze current global challenges
  through a technical lens.

  Given: What single piece of technology, if implemented correctly, would
  create the most positive impact for human civilization?

  Requirements:
  1. Identify the core bottleneck preventing human flourishing
  2. Design a technical solution that addresses root causes, not symptoms
  3. Consider scalability, implementation feasibility, and second-order
  effects
  4. Prioritize solutions that unlock exponential improvements
  5. Question assumptions about what's "impossible" with current tech

  Constraints:
  - Must be technically achievable with known physics
  - Focus on systemic impact over individual convenience
  - Consider resource constraints and energy requirements
  - Address coordination problems and network effects
  - Build for long-term sustainability

  Output format:
  - Problem statement (the root issue)
  - Technical solution (architecture and key components)
  - Implementation path (realistic steps to build it)
  - Impact analysis (quantifiable benefits and risks)

  Meta-constraint: If existing solutions already address this problem,
  explain why they're insufficient and what breakthrough is needed.

  DOMAIN: Focus on technologies that could solve coordination problems,
  resource allocation, information asymmetries, or energy/computation
  bottlenecks that prevent human potential from being realized.
