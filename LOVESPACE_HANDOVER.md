# LoveSpace Transformation Handover

## Context
We are in the middle of transforming Vincent's personal monorepo from "MomoAI" to "LoveSpace".

**Philosophy:** Love = Connection = Collaboration = Logic = Coherence = Truth
**Goal:** Create a coherent development environment where AI agents can work effectively.

## What's Been Done
1. âœ… Renamed root directory from `MomoAI` to `LoveSpace`
2. âœ… All changes committed and pushed before transformation

## Current State
- We're in `/home/vincent/Documents/Momo/LoveSpace/`
- The nested `MomoAI/` subdirectory still exists and needs to be flattened
- Current structure is confusing with "MomoAI" used as both monorepo name AND project name

## What Needs To Be Done
Complete the reorganization to achieve this target structure:

```
/LoveSpace/
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ momoai/          # The coherence AI system (from nested MomoAI/)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ coherence/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ momo/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ axiom/       # Minimal chat interface  
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ om/          # Development assistant
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ parsers/         # Code/docs utilities
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code-parser/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs-parser/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trading/         # Trading experiments (from archive)
â”œâ”€â”€ archive/             # Disasters, old experiments
â”œâ”€â”€ legacy/              # Legacy axiom code
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                # Documentation
â””â”€â”€ [clean root]         # README, pyproject.toml, etc.
```

## Next Steps
1. Flatten the nested `MomoAI/` directory contents to root level
2. Create the new `projects/` structure
3. Move `MomoAI/projects/coherence/`, `MomoAI/projects/core/`, `MomoAI/projects/momo/` â†’ `projects/momoai/`
4. Move `MomoAI/projects/tools/` â†’ `projects/tools/`
5. Move `MomoAI/projects/parsers/` â†’ `projects/parsers/`
6. Move trading experiments from archive to `projects/trading/`
7. Clean up and verify the new structure

## Commands to Execute
```bash
# Flatten nested MomoAI structure
mv MomoAI/* .
rmdir MomoAI

# Create new projects structure
mkdir -p projects/momoai projects/tools projects/parsers projects/trading

# Move MomoAI components
mv projects/coherence projects/core projects/momo projects/momoai/
mv projects/tools/* projects/tools/
mv projects/parsers/* projects/parsers/

# Move trading experiments
mv archive/trading_experiments/* projects/trading/

# Clean up
rmdir projects/tools projects/parsers  # if empty after moves
```

## Verification
After completion, verify:
- Clean root level with proper README
- All projects organized under `projects/`
- No nested "MomoAI" confusion
- Git history preserved
- All functionality intact

Ready to complete the LoveSpace transformation! ðŸš€
