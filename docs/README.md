# MomoAI Project Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the MomoAI coherent AI proof of concept system, along with archived experimental work and research materials.

## Project Structure

### Main Development
- **`MomoAI/`** - Core coherent AI system and proof of concept
  - Primary development focus
  - Contains all active components: axiom, coherence engine, parsers, protocols
  - See `MomoAI/README.md` for detailed system overview

### Archive
- **`archive/disasters/`** - Documentation of past development failures
  - Valuable learning material but isolated from active development
  - Contains coherence disaster reports and lessons learned
  
- **`archive/research/`** - Research documents and brainstorming materials
  - Early research phase documents
  - Coordination engines, consensus infrastructure concepts
  - Background research for the main system

- **`archive/trading_experiments/`** - Trading bot experiments and side projects
  - `momo_funding/` - Complete trading system with backtesting framework
  - `revenue/` - Revenue-focused trading experiments
  - Fun projects separate from main coherent AI work

### Documentation

  - Repository structure and organization
  - Cross-project documentation

## Getting Started

For the main MomoAI system:
```bash
cd MomoAI
uv sync

See `MomoAI/README.md` for detailed setup and development instructions.

## Development Focus

The primary work is in the `MomoAI/` directory. Archive materials are preserved for reference but not part of active development.
