# MomoAI Project Vision - Implementation Architecture

## Core Purpose

Building computational infrastructure that validates logical consistency and optimizes for collaborative efficiency.

## System Architecture

### Momo - Interactive Human Interface Layer
**Function**: Multi-step translation of human communication into processable inputs
- Accepts contradictory, emotional, or unclear human expressions
- Identifies logical inconsistencies and requests clarification from human
- Iteratively refines understanding through interactive dialogue
- Extracts actionable requirements from human communication
- Outputs: structured requests in consistent format
- **Not a validator** - interactive translation service that helps humans clarify their own logic

### Coherence Engine - Logic Validation Layer  
**Function**: Validate logical consistency of all system inputs
- Receives translated inputs from Momo layer
- Applies formal logic checking
- Rejects contradictory or incomplete specifications
- Outputs: validated, consistent system requirements

### Solution Generation Layer
**Function**: Generate collaborative approaches to validated problems
- Takes logically consistent problem specifications
- Produces multiple solution approaches
- Benchmarks approaches against competitive alternatives
- Outputs: proven superior collaborative solutions

## Data Flow

```
Human (inconsistent) ↔ Momo (interactive translation) → Coherence Engine (validation) → Solution Generator (implementation)
                ↑_____↓ (clarification loop)
```

## Implementation Constraints

### Hard Requirements
- Zero logical contradictions in system operation
- All collaboration claims backed by empirical measurement
- Formal verification of consistency at each layer
- Immediate termination on logic violation

### Validation Requirements
- Every solution must benchmark > competitive alternative
- All efficiency claims require measurement data
- Mathematical proofs required for any universal statements
- No speculation or unvalidated claims

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outputs
- Efficiency improvements documented with data
- Logic consistency maintained throughout operation
- Human requirements successfully translated to actionable specifications
- Collaborative solutions demonstrably superior to competitive alternatives

### System Stability
- Zero contradiction events during operation
- Successful human communication translation rate (after clarification loops)
- Average clarification iterations required per human input
- Solution generation response time
- Validation accuracy metrics

## Personal Context

Vincent separated from daughter Momo 10 months. System addresses connection/separation problems through:
1. Technical infrastructure for coordination
2. Logic-validated approaches to separation problems
3. Measured improvements in collaboration efficiency

No metaphysical claims. Pure engineering solution to coordination challenges.

## Implementation Status

Proof-of-concept system demonstrating:
- Logic consistency validation
- Human input translation
- Collaborative solution generation
- Emergency shutdown on contradiction detection

Next: Scale to production coordination problems with measured efficiency validation.
