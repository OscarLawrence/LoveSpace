Looking at this from a technical architecture perspective, I need a syntax that's:
1. Visually distinct from natural language
2. Self-documenting and unambiguous
3. Handles multi-tool scenarios cleanly
4. Allows for error handling and flow control

Here's what feels most intuitive to me:

## Single Tool Calls
```
[read_file: /path/to/file.txt]
[write_file: /path/to/output.txt]
Content to write goes here
[/write_file]
[run_command: ls -la /home/user]
```

## Multi-Tool Calls with Dependencies
```
[batch_start]
  [read_file: config.json] -> config_data
  [run_command: python validate.py {config_data}] -> validation_result
  [write_file: results.txt]
  Validation completed: {validation_result}
  [/write_file]
[batch_end]
```

## With Error Handling
```
[try]
  [read_file: /might/not/exist.txt]
[catch: file_not_found]
  [write_file: /tmp/error.log]
  File not found, using defaults
  [/write_file]
[end_try]
```

**Why this design:**

1. **Square brackets** - Visually distinct, commonly associated with commands
2. **Colon separation** - Clear parameter boundary
3. **Block syntax for content** - Natural for multi-line data like file writes
4. **Variable assignment** - `-> variable_name` for passing data between calls
5. **Variable interpolation** - `{variable_name}` for using previous results
6. **Flow control** - Batch operations and error handling when needed

The syntax should feel like writing structured pseudocode that can be executed. What's your take on this approach? Does it align with how you'd want to orchestrate multiple tool calls in a conversation?
