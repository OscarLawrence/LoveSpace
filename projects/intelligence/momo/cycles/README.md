# Momo AI Cycles

## Four Independent Autonomous Cycles

### 1. Problem Identification Cycle
**Purpose**: Identifies the most critical technical bottlenecks preventing human coordination

**Focus Areas**:
- Coordination failures
- Resource allocation inefficiencies  
- Information asymmetries
- Computational constraints

**Input**: Human problem awareness via Momo Interface Mode 1

### 2. Solution Generation Cycle
**Purpose**: Develops optimal software solutions for identified problems

**Process**: Coherent reasoning to generate software architectures addressing coordination problems

**Output**: Solution designs and specifications

### 3. Implementation Cycle
**Purpose**: Converts solutions into working, deployable code

**Process**: Produces functional code implementing generated solutions

**Output**: Working software implementations

### 4. Optimization Cycle
**Purpose**: Improves existing solutions using coherence-validated human creative input

**Input**: Human creative ideas via Momo Interface Mode 2
**Process**: Integrates human creativity with AI reasoning under coherence constraints
**Output**: Enhanced and optimized solutions

## Coherence Integration

All cycles operate under coherence monitoring:
- Real-time logical consistency validation
- Transparent coherence metrics
- Clean separation of human creativity and AI logic
- Systematic trend measurement toward collaborative solutions

## Hypothesis Testing

The cycles are designed to test whether coherent AI reasoning naturally produces collaborative solutions when solving human coordination problems.
