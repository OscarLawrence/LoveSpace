# Coherence Engine

## Purpose

Software-based coherence validation system for the MomoAI proof of concept.

## Limitations

- **Cannot enforce 100% logical coherence** (requires hardware-level enforcement)
- **Software validation only** - true system needs immediate shutdown on contradictions
- **Works with incoherent AI models** - current AI trained on inconsistent data

## Capabilities

- Real-time measurement of logical consistency
- Transparent coherence metrics display
- Validation of reasoning chains
- Integration point for human input validation

## Architecture

### Coherence Validator
- Monitors AI reasoning for logical contradictions
- Measures consistency across reasoning chains
- Provides real-time feedback on coherence quality

### Human Input Validation
- Validates human creative input for logical consistency
- Ensures clean separation between human creativity and AI logic
- Prevents contamination of reasoning chains

## Expected Outcomes

- Directional evidence that coherence improves solution quality
- Measurable improvements over baseline AI reasoning
- Demonstration of feasible coherence monitoring architecture
